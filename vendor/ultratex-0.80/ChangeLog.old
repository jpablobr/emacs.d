1999-04-28  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <palmieri@member.ams.org>>

	* lisp/ultex-sym.el (ultex-sym-arrows): added a few arrows

1999-04-24  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.55.

	* lisp/ultex.el (ultex-read-key-sequence,
	ultex-last-meta-command-string): Deleted these functions.

	* lisp/ultex.el (ultra-tex-menu): Modified so as to work with
	XEmacs.  Added new functions ultex-menu-add, ultex-menu-add-1, and
	ultex-menu-define-xemacs, also.

	* lisp/ultex.el (ultex-reset-greek-keys, ultex-greek-insert, etc.):
	Rewrote to have all Emacs key binding syntaxes available.

	* user/greek.el: Added examples with new syntax.  Also, removed
	Greek key bindings from C-h and C-g, since these should have other
	behaviors in Emacs (C-h should be a help key, and C-g should be a
	quit key).  Also, since the C-M-Greek keyboard was unused, I
	filled it with a bunch of different arrows.

	* lisp/ultex.el (ultex-grab): Added new optional arguments min and
	max.

	* lisp/ultex-cus.el (ultex-run-text-mode-hook): New variable.
	
	* lisp/ultex.el (ultra-tex-mode): Use the new variable.
	
	* lisp/ultex-cus.el (ultex-return-checks-for-new-commands): New
	variable.

	* lisp/ultex.el (ultex-ret-add-command): New function to use new
	variable.  Also modify ultex-over-and-out to call this function.
	
	* lisp/ultex-cus.el (ultex-display-pictures, ultex-picture-type,
	ultex-picture-directory): New variables.
	
	* lisp/ultex.el (ultex-display-picture): New function.
	
	* lisp/ultex.el (ultex-show-keys, ultex-show-row): Use these new
	variables and function.
	
	* lisp/ultex-sym.el: New file.  Contains code for drawing tables
	of symbols in XEmacs.

	* lisp/ultex.el (ultex-sym-display-greek, etc.): Entry points for
	ultex-sym stuff.

	* lisp/light.el (completing-insert-file-name): Fixed bug.

1999-02-12  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <palmieri@member.ams.org>>

	* all: Released version 0.54.

	* lisp/light.el (lightning-completion): Fixed bug.

1999-01-27  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* lisp/light.el (lc-completion-buffer-name): New variable, default
	value " *Completions".  Name of buffer in which to display list of
	completions. 

1999-01-26  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <palmieri@member.ams.org>>

	* all: Released version 0.53.

	* lisp/light.el.  Typo: changed `ctrl-x-map' to `ctl-x-map'.

	* lisp/aucify.el.  Defined variables lookup and command to avoid
	byte-compiler warnings. 

	* lisp/ultex.el (ultex-permanent-alist, ultex-current-commands):
	  Changed the roles of these variables--the former is what is read 
	  from the various textree files, while the latter contains only
	  commands scanned from the current file.  (ultex-current-commands
	  used to be ultex-permanent-alist, modified by the scanning of
	  the current file.)

1999-01-19  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <palmieri@member.ams.org>>

	* all: Released version 0.53.

	* lisp/ultex.el (ultex-reset-greek-keys): bug fix in greek meta
	keys with XEmacs.

1999-01-18  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* lisp/aucify.el (LaTeX-bibliography-list): define this if not
	already defined.

1999-01-14  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.51.

	* lisp/light.el: Added more stuff to make the defcustom things
	work better when a recent version of the custom package is not
	available.

	* lisp/ultex-cus.el: Ditto.

1998-12-21  John H. Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.50.

	* lisp/ultex.el: Added delay time--Ultra-TeX mode has its own
	delay time for completion, ultex-complete-idle-time.  Added
	support for multiple textree files--which ones are loaded depends
	on the documentclass/style and packages.  In connection with this,
	changed ultex-new-cs so it can write to any of the textree files
	associated to the current buffer.  New function:
	ultex-delete-csname-from-tree-file--delete TeX command from
	textree file.  Fixed a bug with undefined Greek keys.  Added a
	menu to run a few Ultra-TeX functions.  Removed support for GNU
	Emacs version 18.
	
	* lisp/aucify.el: Added customization code, much of which was
	taken from the AUC-TeX package.  Added a menu to run TeX
	commands, taken from the AUC-TeX package.

	* lisp/ultex-cus.el: New file, containing customization code for
	Ultra-TeX mode.  Moved user-customizable variables from ultex.el
	and ultex-setup.el into this file, and rewrote for use with the
	customization package.  Made a few changes to these variables; for
	instance, the program should now be able to make a good guess as
	to the default values for the location of the textree.el and
	greek.el files.

	* lisp/ultex-setup.el: Moved almost everything from here to
	ultex-cus.el.

	* lisp/light.el: Tried to clean up query-replace behavior.

	* texi/ultra.texi: Modified to take the customization and other
	changes into account.

1998-12-16  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* texi/light.texi: Rewrote to take the customization and
	idle-time changes into account.

	* lisp/light.el: Implemented customization stuff for lightning
	completion.  Also implemented lightning completion only after a
	specified idle time: only try to complete if Emacs is idle for
	lc-complete-idle-time-default.  Also fixed a few bugs; for
	example, the function lc-help used to use single-key-description,
	which barfed when you passed it arguments like [(control c)].  Now
	it uses a modified version of key-description, so (a) it doesn't
	barf and (b) it may even work right.  Removed support for GNU
	Emacs version 18.

1998-12-10  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* lisp/ultex.el (ultex-new-cs): changed buffer-string to
	buffer-substring-no-properties.

1998-09-28  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.41.

	* ultex.el (various): Fixed bug with SPC in Greek keys map.

1998-09-25  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.40.

	* ultex.el: Define the variable TeX-master before referring to it,
	to avoid compiler warning.

1998-09-24  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <palmieri@member.ams.org>>

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-inputnames): Include the value of the
	variable TeX-master, if a string, among the files from which to
	grab defs.

	* ultex.el (ultra-tex-mode): Read local variables from file before
	grabbing defs.

1998-09-03  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.39.

	* light.el (light-mode-map): Changed the default keybinding to
	make backspace (etc.) to the right thing in XEmacs.

1998-09-02  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* light.texi: Fixed a little bit of the documentation.

	* sample-keys.el: Changed some of the suggested key bindings.

1998-04-28  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.38.

	* ultex-el (ultex-make-ref-from-label): Call ultex-grab-defs
	instead of ultex-grab, in order to get recursive behavior.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-loop): Added arguments COMMANDS and LABELS
	to be passed to ultex-grab.

	* ultex-el (ultex-grab-defs): Added optional arguments NO-COMMANDS
	and NO-LABELS.

1998-04-17  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.37.

	* ultex.el (ultex-greek-meta-insert): Fixed bug.  Hitting ` Esc y
	would work, but ` M-y would not, at least in Emacs 20.  Now both
	should work.

	* light.el (lc-emacs-20-p): New variable.  Non-nil if using Emacs
	20.

1998-04-07  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.36.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-bibs, ultex-scan-bbl, -bib): These didn't
	used to work right with an optional argument when
	ultex-alist-local-flag was t.  Now they do.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab): New function.  Replaces
	ultex-grab-commands and ultex-grab-labels.

1998-03-27  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.35.

	* ultex.el (ultex-get-next): Didn't work right when trying to find
	\newcommand right at the start of a buffer (which can happen in
	input files).  Fixed now.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-commands, -labels): These didn't used to
	work right with an optional argument when ultex-alist-local-flag
	was t.  Now they do.

	* ultex.el (ultex-command-grabber): New function.  This tries to
	guess what Emacs should complete on when you hit TAB.

	* ultex.el (ultra-tex-mode-map): If ultex-dont-use-completion is
	t, then C-\ is now bound to nil (it used to be bound to
	self-insert-command).

1998-03-27  Mike Mandell  <mandell@math.mit.edu>

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-defs, etc.): This now recursively scans all
	input and include files for commands, labels, etc.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-commands): Also recognizes
	\DeclareMathSymbol.

	* ultex.el (ultex-tab-resume): Now takes an optional argument
	INIT, so that hitting TAB resumes completion better.  This now
	calls ultex-fast-noslash.

	* ultex.el (ultex-fast-noslash): Now takes an optional argument
	INIT, so that hitting TAB resumes completion better.

1998-03-23  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.34.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-commands, ultex-grab-labels): Fixed bug.
	ultex-end and ultex-start were being set before the file fn was
	read; this has been corrected.

1997-10-31  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* all: Released version 0.33.

	* ultex.el (ultex-slash-dollar-is-not-math): New variable.  When
	non-nil -- the default -- then hitting $ when the point is right
	after a backslash only inserts one dollar sign (to make inserting
	\$ easier).  If you are in math mode, hitting a $ behaves as
	before.  (If you really want to use \$ a lot, then put it into
	your textree file.)

	* ultex.el (ultex-smart-dollars): Implemented the above change.

1997-09-22  John H Palmieri  <"John H. Palmieri" <John.H.Palmieri.2@nd.edu>>

	* ultex-setup.el (font-lock stuff): Changed to work with GNU Emacs
	20.1.

Tue Sep  2 10:46:06 1997  John H Palmieri  <jpalmier@pony>

	* all: Released version 0.32.

	* light.el (lc-display-key): Fixed typo: this used to be set to
	(control t); now it is set to (control i).

Tue Aug  5 11:59:50 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@schauder.mit.edu>

	* ultex-setup.el (font-lock stuff): Bug fix: now emacs-19 uses
	colors if ultex-use-color is non-nil, even if font-lock is
	ordinarily turned off.

Fri Aug  1 16:03:52 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@schauder.mit.edu>

	* all: Released version 0.31.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-bibs): Bug fix: you used to get an error
	when running this function in a buffer that was not associated to
	a file (e.g., if a TeX buffer was opened by the Emacs web browser,
	and ultra-tex-mode was started).  This has been fixed.

Wed Jul 30 21:04:58 1997  John H. Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* all: Released version 0.30.

	* lisp/aucify.el (ultex-ignore-auctex-tex.el): New variable.  If
 	non-nil	(the default), then the AUC-TeX file tex.el will not be
	loaded when tex-buf asks for it.  (This is so users can use
	tex-buf.el without having access to the entire AUC-TeX
	distribution.)

	* README: Changed to reflect new organization.

	* INSTALLATION: New file.

	* organization (everything): Reorganized all the files--put
 	everything into different directory a la gnus and w3.

	* texi/light.texi, texi/ultex.texi: Changed installation
	instructions accordingly, and documented the variable
	ultex-ignore-auctex.

	* lisp/docomp.el: New file.  Stupid byte-compilation tricks.

	* lisp/font-latex.el: Now included with the distribution.

	* lisp/tex-buf.el: Now included with the distribution.  (Part of
	the AUC-TeX package.)

Wed Jul 23 17:02:09 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@schauder.mit.edu>

	* all: Released version 0.26.

	* ultex.el (ultex-make-ref-from-label): Changed so that this paid
	attention (correctly) to the variable ultex-alist-local-flag.

	* light.el (light-mode-map): Added a few lines to make sure that
	return and linefeed would be set to 'lc-exit-and-then.

Fri May  2 17:49:27 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* ultex.el (ultex-math-mode): Don't test to see if point is in
	math mode, if line is commented out.

	* ultex.el (ultra-tex-mode): Set comment-multi-line to nil, since
	for some odd reason it is t in XEmacs.

Mon Mar  3 14:47:48 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* ultex.el (various): Changed Greek keyboard stuff so that it uses
 	the old version of greek.el, so that it is backwards compatible.

	* ultex18.el (various): Changed Greek keyboard stuff so that it
 	uses the old version of greek.el, as above.

Fri Feb 28 12:31:07 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* all: Released version 0.25.

	* light.texi (various): Updated the documentation to reflect lots
	of changes.

	* ultra.texi (various): Updated the documentation to reflect lots
	of changes.

	* bufcomp.el (nil): Deleted this file, because:

	* light.el (buffer completion): Incorporated buffer completion
	stuff into light.el.

Thu Feb 27 16:56:16 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* ultex18.el (everything): ultex.el is no longer completely
	compatible with GNU Emacs 18, so when using that program, you need
	to load ultex18.el in addition.  (Actually, ultex18.el
	automatically loads ultex.el, so you only need to load
	ultex18.el.  Actually, ultex-setup.el should figure out which
	version of Emacs you are using, and load the appropriate thing.
	Just make sure that both ultex.el and ultex18.el are in your
	load-path.)

	* light.el (lc-message): Fixed a bug, so this now works when
	resize-minibuffer-mode isn't defined.

	* light.el (lc-quit): Set lc-prev-windows to nil more often, so
	there aren't stray window-configurations setting floating around.

	* light.el (light-mode-map): Screwed around a little to make
	XEmacs work better with the *Completions* buffer.

	* light.el (lc-display-completions): Screwed around to make XEmacs
 	work better with the *Completions* buffer.

	* light.el (lc-display-completions-internal): New function.
	Displays *Completions* buffer as appropriate, depending on the
	version of Emacs.

	* light.el (lc-completion-default-help-string): New variable.
	Used to display a message in the *Completions* buffer in XEmacs. 

	* light.el (lc-completion-setup-function): Modified to use
	lc-completion-message-function. 

	* light.el (lc-completion-default-message-function): New
	function.  Default value for lc-completion-message-function.

	* light.el (lc-completion-message-function): New variable.  Use
	this to customize the message printed in the *Completions*
	buffer.

	* ultex.el (ultex-try-to-complete): New function, for use when
 	ultex-dont-use-completion is non-nil.  Try to complete TeX command
 	sequence just before point, but don't enter lightning completion
 	mode.  If there is a unique completion, insert it.  If there are
 	several choices, pop up a new buffer listing them (but one can't
 	select an option from that buffer).  Etc.

	* ultex.el (ultra-tex-mode): This now calls
 	ultex-define-ultra-tex-mode-map, if ultra-tex-mode-map is nil.  It
 	also calls ultex-reset-greek-keys in this case.

	* ultex.el (several defvars): Added documentation strings.

	* ultex.el (ultex-define-ultra-tex-mode-map): New function.  This
	function defines the Ultra-TeX keymap; this used to happen as a
	top-level thing, but it seems better to let a function do it.  The
	procedure for defining the keymap was changed a bit, to
	incorporate new variables like ultex-dont-use-completion and
	ultex-match-braces (see below).  Also, the Greek keyboard is
	handled differently now: the ` key is actually a prefix
	character.

	* ultex.el (ultex-reset-greek-keys): New function.  This defines
	the Greek keyboard keymap.

	* ultex.el (ultex-greek-map, ultex-greek-meta-map): New
	variables.  These are the keymaps for the Greek keyboard.

	* ultex.el (ultex-greek-self-insert): New function.  Main binding
	for keys in ultex-greek-map.

	* ultex.el (ultex-greek-meta-insert): New function.  Main binding
	for keys in ultex-greek-meta-map.

	* ultex.el (ultex-redefine-greek-key): Changed because the
	structure of the Greek keymap changed.

	* ultex.el (ultex-dont-use-completion): New variable, to replace
	the function of the same name (see below).  If non-nil, then
	lightning completion is turned off, and the TAB key completes.

	* ultex.el (ultex-match-braces): New variable.  If non-nil (the
	default), then hitting `{' inserts `{}'.

	* ultex.el (ultex-match-brackets): New variable.  If non-nil (not
 	the default), then hitting `[' inserts `[]'.

	* ultex.el (ultex-match-parens): New variable.  If non-nil (not
 	the default), then hitting `(' inserts `()'.

	* ultex.el (etc): Make sure frame-width is defined.

	* ultex.el (ultex-define-key): New function.  Like define-key, but
	a bit more backwards compatible with Emacs 18: if you give it a
	vector for a key sequence, like [(control d)], it doesn't beep.
	It doesn't do anything in fact, and just returns nil.

	* ultex.el (ultex-key-sequence-to-string): New function.  Converts
	a key sequence to a string, but maybe not very well.

	* ultex.el (ultex-last-meta-command-string): New function.
	Returns char if the last event was [(meta char)].  For use with
	XEmacs.

	* ultex.el (ultex-read-key-sequence): New function.  This is a
	front-end for read-key-sequence, to account for differences
	between GNU Emacs and XEmacs.

Fri Feb 14 15:26:34 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* all: Released version 0.24.

	* ultex.el (ultex-show-row): The greek keyboard display now varies
	a little, depending on the width of the current frame.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-bibs): This now handles things like
	\bibliography{file1,file2} properly.

	* ultex.el (ultex-dont-use-completion): New function.  When added
	to ultra-tex-mode-hook, turns off lightning completion, and makes
	TAB key try to complete instead.

	* ultex.el (ultex-rescan-after-new-label): New variable.  If
	non-nil, then rescan the buffer for label information whenever a
	new label is inserted.  

	* ultex.el (ultex-make-ref-from-label): Rewritten with
	ultex-rescan-after-new-label in mind.

	* ultex.el (ultex-current-alist): Replaced this variable with
	ultex-current-commands, ultex-current-labels, ultex-current-bibs.

	* ultex.el (ultex-reset-current-alist): Rewrote to take changes to
	ultex-current-alist into account.  Similarly with the functions
	ultex-fast-cs, ultex-fast-noslash, ultex-delete-csname,
	ultex-tab-resume, and the variable ultex-alist-local-flag.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-defs): This has been broken into two
	pieces: ultex-grab-commands and ultex-grab-labels.

	* light.el (lc-completion-default-message-function): New
	function.  Used for customizing the message in the *Completions*
	buffer.

Tue Feb 11 11:34:12 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* light.el (lc-message): Lightning completion in the minibuffer
	now works better with resize-minibuffer-mode.

Wed Feb  5 13:41:45 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* light.el (completing-insert): Fixed a bug or two regarding
	event-handling (GNU Emacs 19 vs XEmacs stuff).

	* light.el (lc-completion-setup-function): This now uses
	lc-completion-fixup-function rather than
	completion-fixup-function.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-defs, ultex-get-next): No longer hangs (I
	hope) when it comes across nested \def's and similar such things.
	
Mon Jan 27 14:10:40 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* light.el (lc-read-file-name-internal): Now typing .. does the
	right thing when finding a file.  

	* ultex.el (ultex-scan-bbl): Make [] argument to \bibitem
	optional.

	* ultex.el (ultex-parse-colon-path): When there is a trailing //,
	make sure that the given directory is included in the list, not
	just its proper subdirectories.

	* ultex.el (ultex-smart-dollars): When math-mode starts with $,
	don't search for ending math delimiter beyond the end of the
	paragraph. 

	* ultex.el (paragraph-start, paragraph-separate): Removed the
	carats from the default values of these variables (I finally read
	their documentation). 

	* sample.ultex (): Changed using-xemacs to xemacs-flag.

	* ultex-setup.el (xemacs-flag, emacs18-flag): Moved definitions of
	these variables to the top of the file, so they can be used
	throughout this file, and also in the user's .ultex file.  Also
	changed using-xemacs to xemacs-flag in the examples.

Thu Jan 16 16:24:00 1997  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* all: Released version 0.23.

	* ultex.el (dollar sign stuff): Now hitting $ cycles through math
	delimiters even if the math environment is non-empty.  There are
	new functions ultex-change-dollars, ultex-dollar-entry-start, and
	ultex-smart-dollars, and new variable ultex-current-label.

	* ultex.el (ultex-math-mode): No longer beeps when you use math
	mode in arguments to (re)newcommand.  Also no longer treats
	\\[0.5in] as the start of a math environment (it used to, because
	of the substring "\[").

	* ultex.el (ultex-make-ref-from-label): This now beeps if you
	define a label that has been used already.

	* ultex.el (ultex-forward-char): New function.  Tries to go
	forward N characters.  If unsuccessul (because of (bobp) or (eobp)
	or whatever), return nil.

	* ultex.el (ultex-over-and-out): Rewrote using ultex-forward-char
	instead of forward-char.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-defs): Rewrote in a vain effort to clean up
	(and maybe speed up) the code.  Similarly: changed
	ultex-grab-bibs, and introduced new functions ultex-get-next
	and ultex-commented-outp.

	* ultex.el (ultra-tex-mode): Changed values of
	paragraph-ignore-fill-prefix and adaptive-fill-mode so as to make
	comments interact better with auto-fill-mode.  Changed value of
	comment-start-skip so that \% is not treated as the start of a
	comment.

	* ultex.el (ultex-comment-indent): Similar changes.

	* ultex.el (ultex-delete-csname): Added completion on TeX
	commands.

	* ultex.el (ultex-def-regexp): New variable.  Regexp to match
	(re)newcommand, or any other command whose 2nd (or 3rd?) argument
	is used for defining a new command, and hence may or may not be
	set in math mode.

	* ultex.el (ultex-non-math-cs-regexp): Changed default value a bit
	so as to interact better with ultex-math-mode.

	* ultex.el (several variables): Added a bit of documentation. 

	* ultex.el (ultex-dollar-array): Changed the default value of this
	variable.  To use the old value, you should set your
	ultra-tex-mode-hook, as indicated in ultex.el when this variable
	is defined.  Also see the file sample.ultex.

	* sample.ultex (ultra-tex-mode-hook): Indicated how to recover the
	old default value of ultex-dollar-array.

	* light.el (lc-read-file-name-internal): Screwed around with this
	to fix a bug with . and .. (in the old version, if the minibuffer
	said ~/ and you hit . and then TAB, any directory whose name
	started with . would not show up in the list of allowable
	completions).  Things also go a bit faster when using lightning
	completion on big directories.

	* light.el (lc-file-display-filter): Made similar fixes here.

	* light.el (lc-expand-file-name): New function, used in
	lc-read-file-name-internal. 

	* light.el (lc-try-to-complete and lc-self-insert-char-2): New
	functions.  These are not used at the moment, but one might use
	them if one likes the features of lightning completion (completion
	on file names, or whatever, while not in the minibuffer), without
	that silly completion business.  So one could type a file name and
	hit TAB to complete, but that would be the only kind of completion
	going on.

	* light.el (lc-make-command-dark): New function.  This turns off
	lightning completion for COMMAND.

	* light.el (lc-make-command-light): New function.  This turns on
	lightning completion for COMMAND, if you had previously disabled
	it with lc-make-command-dark.

	* light.el (buffer-substring-no-properties): Make sure that this
	function is defined, regardless of the version of emacs.

	* light.el (several places): changed buffer-substring to
	buffer-substring-no-properties.

	* bufcomp.el (several places): changed buffer-substring to
	buffer-substring-no-properties.

Wed Dec 11 11:58:54 1996  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* light.el (light-mode-map): This is now set up using
	lc-define-key.

	* light.el (lc-window-system): New function.  I got tired of
 	seeing "window-system is an obsolete variable" when compiling in
 	XEmacs, so this function uses (console-type) if that is bound,
	else window-system.  (Which means that I still get the stupid
	error message, but now I can feel self-righteous about it.)

	* light.el (key definitions): You can now use vectors to modify
	key definitions.  For example, (setq lc-cycle-key [backspace])
	should be a fine thing to do in your .emacs file.

	* light.el (lc-define-key): New function.  Like define-key, but
	accepts both ascii and vector arguments for KEY.

Tue Dec 10 15:25:38 1996  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-defs): if file is read-only and
	ultex-alist-local-flag is non-nil, don't grab tex commands (don't
	even ask).  Similarly for ultex-grab-bibs.

Tue Dec  3 10:23:32 1996  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* aucify.el (TeX-esc, etc.): added some variables to make
	TeX-command-region work.

	* ultex.el (ultex-uncomment-regexp): new variable.  This is a
	regular expression which should match the start of a line which is
	not commented out.  It is currently set to nil, because other
	values slow things down a bit.

	* ultex.el (ultex-grab-defs): search for command sequences is now
	bound by "\end{document}" if that string is present.

	* ultex.el (key bindings): removed binding for C-c C-g.

Mon Dec  2 21:59:21 1996  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* light.el: Released version 0.22.1.

	* light.el (lc-dark-commands): new variable.  This is a list of
	commands for which lightning completion is disabled.  See the
	variable documentation for an example of its use.

	* light.el (lc-dark-recursive-minibufs): new variable.  If non-nil
	and a number, then don't use lightning completion if
	recursion-depth is bigger than this number.  If non-nil and not a
	number, then don't use lightning completion in recursive
	minibuffers at all.  If nil, then use lightning completion all the
	time, as usual.

	* light.el (lc-display-completions): now handles argument 'jump
	correctly (instead of doing the opposite of what it should have).

Wed Nov 27 16:07:53 1996  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* light.el: Released version 0.22.

	* bufcomp.el (): added the line (provide 'bufcomp)

	* light.el (lightnify): rewrote this function completely.  See
 	documention, or preamble of light.el, for instructions.  Because
 	of this (and a few other little changes), GNU Emacs 19 and XEmacs
 	have much more in common.

	* sample-keys.el (everything): Accordingly, I changed the sample
 	key definitions and lightnifications.

	* light18.el (everything): Because of the changes to light.el,
 	that file is no longer completely compatible with GNU Emacs 18.
  	So if you use GNU Emacs 18, load the file light18.el after you've
 	loaded light.el (or just load light18.el, and that file will make
 	sure you've already loaded light.el).

	* lightnify-old.el (everything): If you prefer the old version of
	the lightnify function, load lightnify-old.el instead of
	light.el.	

Thu Nov 21 15:46:50 1996  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* ultex-setup.el (defun ultra-tex-add-imenu): New function.  Patch
	to make imenu and bib-cite stuff work well together.  Same for
	functions ultra-tex-add-bib-cite-imenu and
	ultra-tex-add-bib-cite.  These are all only intended for use in
	ultra-tex-mode-hook. 

Thu Nov 21 15:44:27 1996  Mark Hovey  <hovey@math.mit.edu>

	* aucify.el (ultex-xdvi-argument): New variable, string-valued.
	Contains arguments to pass to xdvi.

	* aucify.el (ultex-xdvi-landscape-string): New variable.  User
	should set this to the argument for xdvi that uses landscape
	mode.  Default value is "-paper usr".

	* aucify.el (ultex-xdvi-landscape): New function.  This detects
	whether the buffer contains "\special{landscape}" and modifies
	ultex-xdvi-argument appropriately (either adds or removes
	ultex-xdvi-landscape string).

	* aucify.el (TeX-command): Modified this to call
	ultex-xdvi-landscape.

	* aucify.el (misc): Lightnified TeX-command-master and
	TeX-command-region.

Wed Nov 20 16:59:06 1996  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* ultex.el (ultex-imenu-create-index): New function.  This is for
	imenu support.

	* ultex.el (ultra-tex-mode): When you enter ultra-tex-mode,
	now tex-mode-hook is run (along with text-mode-hook and
	ultra-tex-mode-hook).

	* ultex-setup.el (ultex-use-imenu): New variable.  If non-nil,
	then Ultra-TeX uses the imenu package the same way tex-mode does.

	* ultex-setup.el (ultex-use-bib-cite): New variable.  If non-nil,
	then Ultra-TeX uses the bib-cite package.

Tue Nov 19 16:55:36 1996  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* light.el (light-mode-map): Changed the keymap so that (in GNU
	Emacs 19) when you enter lightning completion there is a menu
	called "Light", rather than a menu called "Minibuf".

Tue Nov 19 11:13:34 1996  Mark Hovey  <hovey@math.mit.edu>

	* aucify.el (TeX-auto-add-type): New function.  This was
	accidentally left out the first time, resulting in an error when
	the LaTeX file contained a bibliography environment.  Also added:
	TeX-auto-add-information, TeX-car-string-lessp, TeX-listify,
	TeX-auto-list-information.

	* aucify.el (TeX-auto-parser): New variable.  Also added:
	TeX-auto-parser-temporary, TeX-auto-parser-add,
	TeX-auto-parser-local, TeX-auto-parser-change.

Thu Nov 14 11:51:41 1996  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.mit.edu>

	* light.el: Released version 0.21.
	
	* light.texi (Key bindings): Changed documentation to reflect the
	new keybindings.

	* light.el (lc-ignored-file-extensions): Variable.  This is now
	defined using defvar rather than setq.

	* light.el (lc-completion-setup-function): New function.
	Lightning completion version of completion-setup-function.  (The
	only difference is in the text displayed at the top of the
	*Completions* buffer.)

	* light.el (lc-choose-completion-string): New function.  Lightning
	completion version of choose-completion-string.  It adds the
	selected completion to lc-stack, and then quits lightning
	completion, if appropriate.

	* light.el (lc-choose-completion): New function.  Lightning
	completion version of choose-completion.  (The only difference is
	that this calls lc-choose-completion-string instead of
	choose-completion-string.)
	
	* light.el (lc-mouse-choose-completion): New function.  Lightning
 	completion version of mouse-choose-completion.  (The only
 	difference is that this calls lc-choose-completion-string instead
 	of choose-completion-string.)

	* light.el (lc-switch-to-completions): New function.  Creates
	*Completions* buffer (if necessary) and moves the point to it so
	that one can choose a completion with the RET key.  (Like the
	function switch-to-completions from simple.el, but modified for
	use with lightning completion.)

	* light.el (lc-display-completions): Fixed behavior of TAB key.
  	In Emacs 18, repeatedly hitting the TAB key (or whatever key was
 	bound to lc-display-key) would scroll one screen at a time until
 	it reached the bottom of the *Completions* buffer.  Then hitting
	the key again would take you back to the top.  This was broken in
	Emacs 19 (due to a bug in Emacs, I think), but it has been fixed
	now.
	
	* light.el (lc-display-completions): Added lines to alter the text
	inserted in *Completions* buffer (i.e., so that
	lc-completion-setup-function is called rather than
	completion-setup-function), and also so that the keybindings
	call the lightning completion forms of the choose-completion
	functions.  This new version doesn't really work with XEmacs, so
	there is a separate defun in case lc-xemacs-flag is non-nil.

	* light.el (lc-quit): Added 'mouse as possible value for ARG.
  	Clicking with the mouse on another buffer passes this value; it
 	makes lightning completion quit as usual, but does not reset the
 	window-configuration (because you don't want to delete the
 	*Completions* buffer before you have a chance to select from it).

	* light.el (lc-quit): Added 'choose as possible value for ARG.
  	This value is passed when you choose a completion from the
 	*Completions* buffer via lc-choose-completion or
 	lc-mouse-choose-completion.  This is a dumb fix to try to put the
	point in the right place after inserting the completion.

	* light.el (completing-insert): Have light-mode-map be the
	overriding keymap as rarely as possible.  Also, set
	mouse-leave-buffer-hook to 'lc-quit.  

	* light.el (lc-quit): Made similar changes: reset overriding
	keymap and mouse-leave-buffer-hook if necessary.

	* light.el (lc-completion-list-mode-map):  New variable.  This is the
	keymap used for selecting a completion from the *Completions*
	buffer.

	* light.el (light-mode-map): changed the default value of this
 	variable to be compatible with the bindings used with the default
 	Emacs completion (i.e., made light-mode-map look like
 	minibuffer-local-completion-map).

	* light.el (lc-used-old-lc-keymap): New variable.  Set this to
 	non-nil if you want to use the old lightning completion keymap.

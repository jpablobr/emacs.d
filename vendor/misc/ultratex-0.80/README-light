Lightning completion package
----------------------------------
(Version 0.60 of 1999/04/28)

The lightning completion package lets Emacs use "dynamic completion"
on any number of things.  By dynamic completion, I mean that you don't
need to hit the tab key to initiate completion: once it is on, it
stays on until there is a unique completion or it is turned off.  This
can be disconcerting at first, but once you get used to it, it is
quite useful--especially when used with commands like find-file or
describe-function.

Please read the documenation (in the texi directory) for more
information.

The lightning completion package was written by Mark Haiman and Nick
Reingold, then modified by John Palmieri (including getting everything
to work with Emacs 19).  Many suggestions were made by various people
at MIT, Yale, and elsewhere.

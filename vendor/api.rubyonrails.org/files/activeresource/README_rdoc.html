  <div class="description"><h1>Active Resource</h1>
<p>
Active Resource (ARes) connects business objects and Representational State
Transfer (REST) web services.  It implements object-relational mapping for
REST web services to provide transparent proxying capabilities between a
client (ActiveResource) and a RESTful service (which is provided by Simply
RESTful routing in ActionController::Resources).
</p>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>
Active Resource attempts to provide a coherent wrapper object-relational
mapping for REST web services. It follows the same philosophy as Active
Record, in that one of its prime aims is to reduce the amount of code
needed to map to these resources.  This is made possible by relying on a
number of code- and protocol-based conventions that make it easy for Active
Resource to infer complex relations and structures.  These conventions are
outlined in detail in the documentation for <a
href="../../classes/ActiveResource/Base.html">ActiveResource::Base</a>.
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Model classes are mapped to remote REST resources by Active Resource much
the same way Active Record maps model classes to database tables.  When a
request is made to a remote resource, a REST XML request is generated,
transmitted, and the result received and serialized into a usable Ruby
object.
</p>
<h3>Configuration and Usage</h3>
<p>
Putting Active Resource to use is very similar to Active Record. 
It&#8217;s as simple as creating a model class that inherits from <a
href="../../classes/ActiveResource/Base.html">ActiveResource::Base</a> and
providing a <tt>site</tt> class variable to it:
</p>
<pre>
   class Person &lt; ActiveResource::Base
     self.site = &quot;http://api.people.com:3000/&quot;
   end
</pre>
<p>
Now the Person class is REST enabled and can invoke REST services very
similarly to how Active Record invokes life cycle methods that operate
against a persistent store.
</p>
<pre>
   # Find a person with id = 1
   ryan = Person.find(1)
   Person.exists?(1)  # =&gt; true
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, the methods are quite similar to Active Record&#8217;s
methods for dealing with database records.  But rather than dealing
directly with a database record, you&#8217;re dealing with HTTP resources
(which may or may not be database records).
</p>
<h4>Protocol</h4>
<p>
Active Resource is built on a standard XML format for requesting and
submitting resources over HTTP.  It mirrors the RESTful routing built into
Action Controller but will also work with any other REST service that
properly implements the protocol. REST uses HTTP, but unlike
&#8220;typical&#8221; web applications, it makes use of all the verbs
available in the HTTP specification:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
GET requests are used for finding and retrieving resources.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
POST requests are used to create new resources.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
PUT requests are used to update existing resources.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>
DELETE requests are used to delete resources.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For more information on how this protocol works with Active Resource, see
the <a
href="../../classes/ActiveResource/Base.html">ActiveResource::Base</a>
documentation; for more general information on REST web services, see the
article <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">here</a>.
</p>
<h4>Find</h4>
<p>
Find requests use the GET method and expect the XML form of whatever
resource/resources is/are being requested.  So, for a request for a single
element, the XML of that item is expected in response:
</p>
<pre>
   # Expects a response of
   #
   # &lt;person&gt;&lt;id type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;&lt;attribute1&gt;value1&lt;/attribute1&gt;&lt;attribute2&gt;..&lt;/attribute2&gt;&lt;/person&gt;
   #
   # for GET http://api.people.com:3000/people/1.xml
   #
   ryan = Person.find(1)
</pre>
<p>
The XML document that is received is used to build a new object of type
Person, with each XML element becoming an attribute on the object.
</p>
<pre>
   ryan.is_a? Person  # =&gt; true
   ryan.attribute1  # =&gt; 'value1'
</pre>
<p>
Any complex element (one that contains other elements) becomes its own
object:
</p>
<pre>
   # With this response:
   #
   # &lt;person&gt;&lt;id&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;&lt;attribute1&gt;value1&lt;/attribute1&gt;&lt;complex&gt;&lt;attribute2&gt;value2&lt;/attribute2&gt;&lt;/complex&gt;&lt;/person&gt;
   #
   # for GET http://api.people.com:3000/people/1.xml
   #
   ryan = Person.find(1)
   ryan.complex  # =&gt; &lt;Person::Complex::xxxxx&gt;
   ryan.complex.attribute2  # =&gt; 'value2'
</pre>
<p>
Collections can also be requested in a similar fashion
</p>
<pre>
   # Expects a response of
   #
   # &lt;people type=&quot;array&quot;&gt;
   #  &lt;person&gt;&lt;id type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;1&lt;/id&gt;&lt;first&gt;Ryan&lt;/first&gt;&lt;/person&gt;
   #  &lt;person&gt;&lt;id type=&quot;integer&quot;&gt;2&lt;/id&gt;&lt;first&gt;Jim&lt;/first&gt;&lt;/person&gt;
   # &lt;/people&gt;
   #
   # for GET http://api.people.com:3000/people.xml
   #
   people = Person.find(:all)
   people.first  # =&gt; &lt;Person::xxx 'first' =&gt; 'Ryan' ...&gt;
   people.last  # =&gt; &lt;Person::xxx 'first' =&gt; 'Jim' ...&gt;
</pre>
<h4>Create</h4>
<p>
Creating a new resource submits the XML form of the resource as the body of
the request and expects a &#8216;Location&#8217; header in the response
with the RESTful URL location of the newly created resource.  The id of the
newly created resource is parsed out of the Location response header and
automatically set as the id of the ARes object.
</p>
<pre>
  # &lt;person&gt;&lt;first&gt;Ryan&lt;/first&gt;&lt;/person&gt;
  #
  # is submitted as the body on
  #
  # POST http://api.people.com:3000/people.xml
  #
  # when save is called on a new Person object.  An empty response is
  # is expected with a 'Location' header value:
  #
  # Response (201): Location: http://api.people.com:3000/people/2
  #
  ryan = Person.new(:first =&gt; 'Ryan')
  ryan.new?  # =&gt; true
  ryan.save  # =&gt; true
  ryan.new?  # =&gt; false
  ryan.id    # =&gt; 2
</pre>
<h4>Update</h4>
<p>
&#8216;save&#8217; is also used to update an existing resource - and
follows the same protocol as creating a resource with the exception that no
response headers are needed - just an empty response when the update on the
server side was successful.
</p>
<pre>
  # &lt;person&gt;&lt;first&gt;Ryan&lt;/first&gt;&lt;/person&gt;
  #
  # is submitted as the body on
  #
  # PUT http://api.people.com:3000/people/1.xml
  #
  # when save is called on an existing Person object.  An empty response is
  # is expected with code (204)
  #
  ryan = Person.find(1)
  ryan.first # =&gt; 'Ryan'
  ryan.first = 'Rizzle'
  ryan.save  # =&gt; true
</pre>
<h4>Delete</h4>
<p>
Destruction of a resource can be invoked as a class and instance method of
the resource.
</p>
<pre>
  # A request is made to
  #
  # DELETE http://api.people.com:3000/people/1.xml
  #
  # for both of these forms.  An empty response with
  # is expected with response code (200)
  #
  ryan = Person.find(1)
  ryan.destroy  # =&gt; true
  ryan.exists?  # =&gt; false
  Person.delete(2)  # =&gt; true
  Person.exists?(2) # =&gt; false
</pre>

Here is a list of feature I might implement:
 - A perl parser as backend for code intelligence. Maybe use semantic
 as frontend.
 - More features for perldebugger, including debug evaled code, show
 array and hash in watch buffer, pretty display for stack and
 breakpoint, display global variables and functions
 - Completions in interactive shell
